Original software for MeterView recovered off one of my old computers.

As of yet untested, although it does start up and display on my newer computers without any errors. Unfortunately the help documentation didn't survive the transfer.

If someone that comes across this has the original software installer image please feel free to push it to this repo or make a new one and link it in an issue thread.

Same applies if someone happens to have the original source code of this, and that would be epic.
